\chapter{Performance metrics} \label{appx:perf}

This appendix presents performance metrics for the desktop application
implemented using the \emph{High performance C++ Profiler}. For further
details refer to section~\ref{sec:results:perf}.

Each performance metric contains two tables. The first is ordered by
function structure and total cycles the CPU spent on that function. The second
table is ordered by self cycles, which represents the total cycles the CPU spent
on that function minus the total cycles the CPU spent on the children functions.
